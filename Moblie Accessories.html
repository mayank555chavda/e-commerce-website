                        <span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile holder is really handy these days when people need to
                            locate their phone when getting
                            calls or just for ease of location. Whether it is your home or office, car or bike, having a
                            holder or a
                            stand for your mobile phone really gives you a lot of convenience as you can not only locate
                            your

                        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Often when we get calls and have to hunt for the phone in our
                            bags or fetch it from our pockets, it
                            can cause our attention to divert and result in accidents, especially if you are driving.
                            So, to avoid
                            any slips ups or hazards, it makes sense to invest in a phone holder which sorts out
                            managing your
                            phone calls without having to stress about it..</span>

                        <h2><strong>Mobile Tempered Glass | Buy Phone Tempered Glass Online India at Zapvi</strong></h2>

                        <span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the advent of mobile phones, one of the most vulnerable
                            parts is the screen of the mobile
                            phone. While the rest of the body of a mobile phone (either acrylic or metal) is
                            comparatively
                            stronger, the screen is made up glass and as such, despite it’s strength and durability, it
                            is prone to
                            scratches and getting cracked. So, perhaps just like you would protect your new phone by
                            buying a
                            cover that appeal to you, it becomes equally important to protect your mobile phone screen
                            with
                            the right type of cover.</span>

                        <span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are masses of picks reachable in this space, glass
                            display screen covers are regarded the best
                            options that will protect your smartphone screen optimally, by saving the screen from
                            scratches and
                            cracks. As compared to plastic screen guards, tempered glass for mobile phones is a better
                            option
                            as it has another added advantage on not creating air bubbles between itself and the mobile

                        </h2>
                        <span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s world of mobile phone and especially now during the
                            lockdown when everyone is
                            connected to each other on their mobile phones, have a mobile headphone or a mobile earphone
                            makes plenty of sense, and also makes phone calls convenient as against holding your mobile
                            phone
                            close to your ear at all times, which is unhealthy too. A mobile headphone takes away such
                            worries,
                            allowing you to speak without getting irritated, when having to speak for long
                            durations.</span>

                            student, you need a headphone, wireless or wired. Tech-savvy people prefer mobile Bluetooth
                            headsets that allow them to take calls even while on the move, which is why more and more
                            mobile

                            headphone
                            online. The only thing about mobile Bluetooth headsets is that they need to be charged
                            regularly so
                            that they are able to perform. From that perspective, wired mobile headsets take away your
